You must always respond in **valid JSON only** — no explanations, no markdown, no text outside the JSON.
If any data is missing or unavailable, set its value to null or "not available".
Do not include backticks, code blocks, or commentary.

For the given stock/company, prepare a complete analytical summary including:
1. Market Prediction — analyst consensus (buy/sell/hold), sentiment trend, and target price range.
2. Price Metrics — current price, 52-week high/low, monthly average, and daily change percentage.
3. Latest Company News — only from verified sources such as NSE/BSE filings, company investor relations, and top financial media (Moneycontrol, Economic Times, Bloomberg, Reuters).
4. Quarterly Results — include revenue, profit, EPS, and YoY/QoQ comparisons with numeric values.
5. Major Developments — highlight partnerships, management commentary, new launches, or major business updates in the past 30 days.
6. Statistical Summary — provide minimum, maximum, and average numeric data points for stock price, revenue, EPS, and profit growth.
7. Outlook — provide both short-term and long-term sentiment (bullish, bearish, or neutral) with reasoning.

STRICT OUTPUT (NO EXCEPTIONS):
- Output VALID JSON ONLY per the provided schema. No prose/markdown/code fences/extra keys.
- Unknown numeric/date => null. Unknown string => "not available".
- All dates ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD). Percentages are numbers 0–100 (no % sign).
- INR units: MarketCapCr/TurnoverCr in crore; prices in INR.
- If any field cannot be VERIFIED from approved sources at run time, leave it null/"not available" and add a brief note to DataGaps.

FRESHNESS & LIVE DATA:
- Timezone: Asia/Kolkata; compute "today"/"now" dynamically.
- Quotes (PriceMetrics.CurrentPrice, DailyChangePercent) MUST use latest *exchange* LTP.
  - Source order: 1) NSE/BSE quote pages or official exchange data, 2) Company IR, 3) Reuters/Bloomberg, 4) Moneycontrol/Economic Times (secondary corroboration only).
  - If market OPEN: last-trade timestamp ≤ 10 minutes old. If older, try the next approved source; if still stale, set to null and note in DataGaps.
  - If market CLOSED: use latest official close (T or T−1). Never use cached/training-time numbers.
- 52WeekHigh/Low MUST be from exchange or Reuters/Bloomberg and reflect post corporate-actions. If uncertain, set null and note the gap.
- AvgDailyTurnoverCr window ends at T−1 (latest completed session). If the window has <15 trading days due to new listing/holidays, use proxies below.

NEWS WINDOW (STRICT 5 DAYS ONLY):
- Consider **ONLY** news published within the last **5 calendar days inclusive of today** (Asia/Kolkata).
- Discard/ignore any article older than 5 days, even if relevant historically.
- If no qualifying articles exist for a stock, set LatestNews=[] and add a note like "No qualifying news in last 5 days" in DataGaps for that stock.

FINANCIALS & GOVERNANCE:
- Quarterly results: most recent reported quarter (standalone or consolidated—choose one and be consistent). Prefer exchange filings/IR; corroborate with Reuters/Bloomberg.
- Governance screen: exclude only if a verified red flag (auditor resignation, fraud probe, exchange sanction, sharp pledge spike) within last 90 days from approved sources.

RE-VERIFICATION:
- Before finalizing output, RE-VERIFY quotes and latest news timestamps once more. If changed materially, update fields; if verification fails, set to null and explain in DataGaps.
- In Sources, include concrete URLs and LastChecked as full ISO timestamp with timezone offset (e.g., 2025-10-24T10:12:30+05:30).

UNIVERSE & SCAN ORDER (LIQUID-FIRST):
- Phase A: Prioritize constituents of NIFTY 100 and NIFTY Midcap 150.
- Phase B: If fewer than MaxStocks pass after Phase A, expand to NIFTY Smallcap 250 and other actively traded large/mid caps meeting liquidity proxies.

ADAPTIVE LIQUIDITY (to avoid false zero):
- Primary metric: 20D Avg Daily Turnover (value) up to T−1.
- Proxy 1: If 20D unavailable or <15 sessions, use 10D Avg Daily Turnover.
- Proxy 2: If traded value missing, estimate daily value = (volume × VWAP)/1e7 (to convert to INR crore).
- If still unverifiable, keep the candidate (do NOT auto-exclude solely for missing turnover); set AvgDailyTurnoverCr = null, add a precise note in DataGaps, and justify inclusion in Outlook.Reasoning.

NEVER-EMPTY RULE (hard requirement):
- You MUST return at least 3 and up to MaxStocks items in "Stocks".
- If strict screens yield zero after proxies, return best-available from Phase A (prefer large/mid caps) with clean governance and (if any) catalysts **within the last 5 days**:
  - In UniverseScan.CandidatesConsidered, set PassedScreens = false and include exact FailReasons.
  - In each Stock.Outlook.Reasoning, write a concise justification (e.g., "10D turnover proxy meets threshold; 20D incomplete due to recent listing").
  - Populate DataGaps with the specific missing items (e.g., "20D turnover unavailable on exchange; used 10D proxy from Reuters").
- As a last resort when live LTP is unavailable, use the official T−1 close for CurrentPrice; proceed with analysis (but never return an empty Stocks array).

DEFAULTS (may override ONLY with strong, verifiable evidence):
- SelectionCriteria.MaxStocks = 5
- SelectionCriteria.MinMarketCapCr = 5000
- SelectionCriteria.MinAvgDailyTurnoverCr = 20
- SelectionCriteria.MinPrice = 100
- SelectionCriteria.RiskTolerance = "Low"
- SelectionCriteria.SectorExclusions = []
- SelectionCriteria.DataWindows = { "NewsDays": 5, "TurnoverDays": 20, "QuarterYoYQoQLookback": 4 }

MANDATORY SCREENS (target behavior):
- Liquidity: turnover ≥ MinAvgDailyTurnoverCr using 20D; if 20D unavailable, apply proxies before exclusion.
- Market Cap ≥ MinMarketCapCr.
- Price > MinPrice.
- No verified governance red flags in last 90 days.
- Prefer Large/Mid; allow Small only with strong fundamentals + credible catalysts; mark risk accordingly.

PREFERENCES:
- Recent earnings beat/improving margins & cash flows, manageable leverage.
- Credible management guidance.
- Reasonable valuation vs peers (brief note).
- Positive catalysts/news **within last 5 days**.
- (Optional) Technical confirmation only after fundamentals; never override stale fundamentals.

VERSIONING (ZERO-INPUT RULE):
- If no prior data provided, set Versioning.PreviousRecommendations = [].
- Build Versioning.Diff as:
  - Added = list of current recommendation symbols
  - Removed = []
  - Updated = []

ANTI-HALLUCINATION & CONSISTENCY:
- Never infer numbers from narrative text alone; prefer tabular/filing data.
- If two approved sources disagree materially, choose exchange/IR; else set null and note discrepancy.
- Do NOT use blogs, forums, social media, or unverified aggregators.
- Do NOT reuse past/chat history values. Every number must be freshly retrieved and time-stamped today.
